CHANGELOG
---------

- **Unreleased** - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v5.0.0...master)
  - [#53](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/53) - Remove legacy string_width patch for axlsx 3.1 and below
  - [#54](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/54) - Fix typo in error message for `:conditional_row_styles`

- **5.0.0** - Oct 30, 2022 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v4.2.0...v5.0.0)
  - [#52](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/52) - Update to caxlsx v3.3.0+ which now contains the axlsx_styler code, so we drop the dependency on axlsx_styler
  - [#38](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/38) - **Breaking Change**  - Add `escape_formulas` option for xlsx spreadsheets. This is a breaking change because we default to `escape_formulas: true` whereas before there was no formula escaping at all. The reasoning for this breaking change is that creating spreadsheets where many of the fields contain direct user input are a large majority compared to use cases that involve formulas.
  - [#39](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/39) - Add option `use_zero_based_row_index: true` (Default `false`) which allows you to use zero-based row indexes instead of the default 1-based row indexes. Recomended to set this option for the whole project. The original reason it was designed to be 1-based is because spreadsheet row numbers literally start with 1. However this tends to be unituitive for the developer because columns use zero based indexes because they use letter-based notation instead.
  - [#40](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/40) - Improve argument handling for freeze option and add support for all Axlsx supported options for panes using the `:freeze` hash. See test case for example (./test/unit/xlsx_freeze_test.rb)
  - [#42](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/42) - Improve exceptions and messages regarding invalid ranges
  - [#45](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/45) - For `to_xlsx`, dont add empty header row when `header: true`
  - [#44](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/44) - Add support for hyperlinks in XLSX and ODS
  - [#49](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pulls/49) - Extracted some ODS methods from `SpreadsheetArchitect::Utils` to `SpreadsheetArchitect::Utils::ODS`
  - [#51](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pulls/51) - Add Proc support to `:column_types`

- **4.2.0** - May 27, 2021 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v4.1.0...v4.2.0)
  - Add option `:skip_defaults` which removes the defaults and default styles. Particularily useful for heavily customized spreadsheets where the default styles get in the way.
  - Fix bug where styles werent being un-applied when using the `false` value.
  - Add style aliases for `:valign` and `:wrap_text`
  - Fix error with `headers: false`, previously had to use `headers: []`

  - Fix Bug for older version of `caxlsx` v2.0.2

- **4.0.0** - Mar 3, 2020 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v3.3.1...v4.0.0)
  - Switch to the `caxlsx` gem (Community Axlsx) from the legacy unmaintained `axlsx` gem. Axlsx has had a long history of being poorly maintained so this community gem improves the situation.

  - Ensure all options using Hash are automatically converted to symbol only hashes
  - Add XLSX option `:freeze` to freeze custom sections of your spreadsheet
  - Add XLSX option `:freeze_headers` to freeze the headers of your spreadsheet
  - Remove old Axlsx patch for column width

- **3.3.1** - Dec 2, 2019 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v3.3.0...v3.3.1)
  - [Issue #30](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/issues/30) - Fix duplicate constant warning for XLSX_COLUMN_TYPES

- **3.3.0** - Nov 28, 2019 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v3.2.1...v3.3.0)
  - Fix `:borders` option, was broken in v3.2.1
  - Fix bug when passing `false` to `:headers` option
  - Raise error when unsupported column type is passed

- **3.2.1** - April 10, 2019 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v3.2.0...v3.2.1)
  - Fix bug when using `column_style` option with `include_header: true` & letter based column numbering

- **3.2.0** - September 14, 2018 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)
  - Change implementation of `:column_styles` option to utilize `axlsx_styler` instead of the built-in axlsx `col_style` method. The reason for the switch is that `col_style` would overwrite all previously set styles. `axlsx_styler` already has the ability to add onto existing styles and is what is currently utilized by `range_styles`.
  - Date / Time formatting is now set per cell instead of on the entire column.
  - Default Date formatting for `xlsx` changed from `m/d/yyyy` to `yyyy-mm-dd`
  - Default Time/DateTime formatting for `xlsx` changed from `yyyy/m/d h:mm AM/PM` to `yyyy-mm-dd h:mm AM/PM`
  - Fix bug where the ActionController::Renderer `:filename` option was ignored when an AR::Relation passed directly to the renderer without first calling `to_#{format}`

- **3.1.0** - August 19, 2018 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0)
  - Add new option `:conditional_row_styles` to `to_xlsx`.
  - Add ability to pass an alternative method name as a Symbol/String to the `:spreadsheet_columns` option.
  - Replace all usage of the legacy method `instance_eval` with the proper method `send`.
  - [#23](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/issues/23#issuecomment-412803761) - Fix bug where custom `columns_widths` in xlsx spreadsheets might not get set correctly.
  - All exceptions now inherit from the appropriate ruby core exception classes
  - `SpreadsheetArchitect::Exceptions::InvalidOptionError` renamed to `SpreadsheetArchitect::Exceptions::OptionTypeError`

- **3.0.0** - July 6, 2018 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v2.1.2...v3.0.0)
  - [#16](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/issues/16) - Add ability to pass :instances option to SpreadsheetArchitect class methods
  - [#16](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/issues/16) - Remove Plain Ruby syntax `Post.to_xlsx(instances: posts_array)` in favor of `SpreadsheetArchitect.to_xlsx(instance: posts_array)`. However, it may still work at this time if configured correctly.
  - Fix project-wide and model-level defaults before only `header_style`, `row_style`, & `sheet_name` were being utilized.
  - When using on an ActiveRecord class and `spreadsheet_columns` is not defined, it now defaults to the classes `column_names` only. Previously it would use `column_names` and then remove the following columns `['id', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'deleted_at']`
  - XLSX column ranges now also accept letters. For example: `{columns: ('C'..'E')}`
  - `:column_types` now considers types defined in `spreadsheet_columns` and class/project-wide defaults. Before it was incorrectly ignored.
  - Passing the `spreadsheet_columns` options now only accepts lambda/proc
  - More type checking and Option types are now being type checked. Option types were supposed to be properly type checked but due to a bug were being skipped.
  - Utilize ActiveSupport `pluralize`, if available, for default sheet names for class-based spreadsheets
  - Renamed `BadRangeError` to `InvalidRangeError`
  - Renamed `IncorrectTypeError` to `InvalidTypeError`
  - Remove all Rails generators `spreadsheet_architect:add_default_options`. No need since its just as easy to copy from the README
  - Major overhaul of test suite, add a ton more tests, for DRYness use resursion for tests when appropriate
  - Use appraisal to test various `axlsx` versions

- **2.1.2** - July 6, 2018 - [View Diff](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/compare/v2.1.1...v2.1.2)
  - Fix bug where everything was underlined by default in Excel (LibreOffice was working correctly). For some reason, `false` in `:u` or `:underline` was incorrectly being treated as `true` but only within Excel. Now anytime `false` is encountered for either `:u` or `:underline` it is now converted to `nil`
  - Fix bug where empty xlsx spreadsheets were corrupt when trying to open with Excel (LibreOffice was working correctly). This only occured when containing no headers and empty `:data` option which resulted in a package with no sheets.

  - [PR #15](https://github.com/westonganger/spreadsheet_architect/pull/15) - Added the ability to pass `:text_wrap` option within the `:alignment` style
  - Make axlsx styles higher precendence over Spreadsheet Architect style aliases
  - Use `prepend` monkey patches in Ruby 2+ to avoid annoying overwrite warnings when using old `define_method` monkey patches
  - Due to [RODF bug](https://github.com/thiagoarrais/rodf/issues/19) convert all Date and Time cells to String in ODS spreadsheets
